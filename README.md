My friend Pat has come up with a business idea: coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. Since we're in Portland, he's also made them vegan so EVERYONE can enjoy them!
For this, Pat has asked for a web application to calculate the number of cookies needed for each of his future locations based on anticipated customers. This is to ensure baking schedules meet supply needs.

# Calculate Daily Sales Prokection
* Store the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer; use object properties.
* Use a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour.
* Calculate simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour.
* Store those results for each location in a separate array.
* Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser
* Calculate the sum of these hourly totals

## Style Guide
Begin a style guide for this with the following:

* A custom Google font for highlights
* A specified standard san-serif web font for data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica)
* A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times, etc.)
* Specified different font colors for all three font usages
* A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)
* A different background color for elements such as boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)
* Anything else you'd like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity, and consistency are good things in design.
